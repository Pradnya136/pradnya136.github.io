  <h1 class="underline">Montessori :-</h1>
  </br>
  <h2>What is it? How Aikyam implements it?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Montessori is a revolutionary method of observing and supporting the natural development of children.</br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Authentic Montessori educational practice helps children develop creativity, problem solving, 
      critical thinking, time-management skills, care of the environment and each other. 
      The basis of Montessori practice in the classroom is mixed age group (for example 
      ,3-6 ages in one class), individual choice of research and work, and uninterrupted concentration."</br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Montessori education enables children to develop the fundamental capacities that they need 
      to become happy and fulfilled adults who contribute to society.</br>
    </li>
    <li>  
      This methodology help children become independent thinkers with a lifelong love of learning.</br>
  
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Montessori classroom is referred to as the prepared environment. It is a meaningfully structured
     learning space where everything has a purpose and a place. Furniture is light and 
     child-sized, learning materials are designed to fit in children’s hands, and everything 
     is designed to be open and accessible. The prepared environment activates a love of 
     learning through curiosity, stability, and the freedom to choose.</br></p>
  <p><span>Aikyam</span> environment is designed to facilitate maximum independent learning and exploration 
    by the child through a variety of activity as well as a great deal of movement.</p></br>
  <h1 class="underline">Sustainable Living :-</h1>
  </br>
  <h2>What is it? How Aikyam implements it?</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Sustainable Living is a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs while preserving
       the environment so that these needs can be met not only in the present, but also
        for generations to come.</br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Children are the most vulnerable to the impacts of unsustainable living with specific harms arising because of 
      their physical and cognitive vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, children do not have to be victims in the
       face of these challenges.</br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Education, including early childhood education, has an important role to in building resilience and capabilities in children that equip them as active 
      and informed citizens now and in the future and who are capable of contributing to
       healthy and sustainable ways of living.</br>
    </li>
    <li>
      It is in the early childhood period that children develop their basic values, attitudes, skills,
       behaviours and habits, which may be long lasting.</br>
    </li>
    <li>
      As early childhood education is about laying a sound intellectual, psychological, emotional, social and physical foundation for development and lifelong learning, it has an enormous potential in fostering values, attitudes, skills and 
      behaviours that support sustainable development – e.g. wise use of resources, cultural diversity, 
      gender equality and democracy.
  
    </li></br></br>
    <p>The child as a right holder, who is an active participant and has his or her contribution to make to 
      society’s present and future,and not an invisible, marginal worthless being.</p></br>
  </ul></br>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In education for sustainable development, young children’s perspectives and meanings are listened to, considered and shape the content and approaches
       of learning. Second, early childhood education for sustainability is much more 
       than environmental education.
    </li></br>
    <li>
     <span>Aikyam</span>  broadens the method than simply taking children outdoors 
      to discover the beauty of nature and speaking about the natural environment.
    </li></br>
    <li>
      We provide the opportunities for children to engage in intellectual dialogue
       regarding sustainability, and in concrete actions in favour of the environment.
    </li></br>
    <li>
      In addition, Aikyam incorporate learning to be compassionate and respect
       differences, equality and fairness as the world is increasingly interdependent and inter-connected.
    </li></br>
    <li>
      <span>Aikyam</span>  refers to the 7Rs for education for sustainable development (reduce,
       reuse, recycle, respect, repair, refl ect and refuse).
   
  
    </li></br>
  </ul>
  
  <h1 class="underline">
    Democratic Education :-
  </h1></br>
  <h2> What is it? How Aikyam implements it?</h2></br>
  <p>Democratic practice in Early Childhood Education
     Community means the adoption and enactment of democracy as a fundamental value. </p></br>
    <p><span>Aikyam</span> implements it by </p> </br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Promising commitment  to cooperation and solidarity, dialogue and listening.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          Respecting for diversity.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          Recognising of multiple perspectives and diverse paradigms.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          Welcoming curiosity, uncertainty and subjectivity – and the responsibility that they require of us.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          Developing a capacity for critical thinking.

      What Is So Special About the Montessori Classroom?
    </label>
    <div class="answers">
      <p>The main elements that distinguish it from other traditional classrooms:<br/><br/>
        · 	All equipment is accessible to your child and is always available to the child.<br/>
        · 	Your child has freedom of movement both indoors and out as well as a choice of what to
         do for much of the day.<br/>
        · 	Your child will have personal responsibility for their work; this requires an
         awareness of the needs of others, avoiding dangerous or hurtful actions, keeping 
         the equipment and resources tidy, putting things away after using them, being good
          role models for younger children, developing a true social awareness.<br/><br/>
        · 	<strong>Beauty and Harmony:</strong> This aspect is too often ignored by those who focus too much on the 
        content of learning. Montessori felt strongly that the environment must be aesthetically
         pleasing to encourage learning and concentration. Too many displays can distract children
          if they are not properly related to their interests. It reflects the manner in which the
           Montessori classroom is calm and activities are self-directed.<br/><br/>
        · <strong>Multi-aged classrooms: </strong>	 Children are grouped in multi-age groups spanning two to three years.
          Multi-age classrooms serve to:  encourage cooperation, minimize competition, provide opportunities
           for indirect learning for younger students as they observe older peers, foster self-confidence in
            students who serve as role models, and provide long-term child/adult relationships.<br/><br/>
        ·  <strong> ​Educational materials</strong>  are concrete to aid the child to learn order, to discriminate physical 
        dimensions, provide opportunities to teach responsibility, coordination, and interdependence, and
         to indirectly prepare for complex abstract concepts. Each child initially responds to an inner
          urge to develop both knowledge and build identity through a spontaneous activity that charts the 
          course for individualized lessons.<br/> </p>

    <label for="question2" class="question">
      How many students are typically in a Montessori class?
    </label>
    <div class="answers">
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Montessori values the lessons of community that can happen when the size of the class is somewhat larger.<br/>
        A larger, multi-age class can encourage students to rely on themselves and 
        their peers as resources, rather than going directly to a teacher for support first.<br/>
       Montessori classes at the Early Childhood level and above might include 20 – 30
        students whose ages span 3 years. All members of the community benefit from this configuration.<br/>
         Older students are proud to act as role models; younger ones feel supported and gain confidence 
         about the challenges ahead. And all children develop their independence as they problem solve
          with their peers within their classroom community.<br/>
       Classes for toddlers are smaller, with typically 10 – 15 children. <br/>
       Often the teacher-to-child ratio for this youngest age group is set by state licensing standards.<br/></p>

    <label for="question3" class="question">
      Why do Montessori teachers encourage my young child to be independent?
    </label>
    <div class="answers">
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helping a child develop independence and self-sufficiency is a hallmark of Montessori programs.<br/> 
        Children who are independent and make self-directed choices develop self-confidence and
         experience pride when they accomplish their goals.<br/> <br/> 
In the Montessori classroom, young children are supported to become autonomous in caring for 
their personal needs and in taking care of their classroom environment. Children are given
freedom of movement and choice over their activities in the classroom and are encouraged 
and supported to “do it for themselves.”<br/> <br/> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Montessori students are self-confident learners who believe in their own abilities to accomplish a task.<br/> 
This confidence and self-reliance sets the stage for all future learning.<br/>. </p>
      
    </div>

    <label for="question4" class="question">
      Is it true that Montessori students are free to do whatever they want, and at their own pace?
    </label>
    <div class="answers">
      <p>            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Maria Montessori observed that children are more motivated to 
        learn when working on something of their own choosing, and at their
         own unique pace.<br/>
          A Montessori student may choose her focus of learning on any given 
          day, but her decision is limited by the materials and activities—in 
          each area of the curriculum—that her teacher has prepared and presented to her. <br/><br/>


          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the Elementary level, students typically set learning goals
         and create personal work plans under their teacher’s guidance.<br/></p>
